> Goal of this project :
- Train a GAN (StyleGAN) on FFHQ/Celba-HQ to generate high-resolution and realistic human faces
- Style transfer : CycleGAN for unpaired image-to-image translation (real face -> Van Gogh style for instance)
- Extraction of features from GAN outputs with a pre-trained VisionTransformer or Classification of styles using a VisionTransformer
- CLIP-based interface for text-driven generation like “a woman in Van Gogh style.” ?
